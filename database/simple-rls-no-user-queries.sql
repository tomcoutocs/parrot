-- Alternative RLS Approach - No User Table Queries
-- This script uses a completely different approach that doesn't query the users table

-- Step 1: Check current RLS status
SELECT '=== CURRENT RLS STATUS ===' as info;

SELECT 
  tablename,
  CASE WHEN rowsecurity THEN 'ENABLED' ELSE 'DISABLED' END as rls_status
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN (
  'projects', 
  'tasks', 
  'document_folders', 
  'documents', 
  'companies', 
  'users', 
  'internal_user_companies',
  'meeting_requests',
  'confirmed_meetings',
  'company_events',
  'user_favorites'
)
ORDER BY tablename;

-- Step 2: Drop all existing policies first
SELECT '=== DROPPING ALL EXISTING POLICIES ===' as info;

DO $$
DECLARE
    policy_record RECORD;
    table_name TEXT;
BEGIN
    -- List of tables to process
    FOR table_name IN 
        SELECT unnest(ARRAY[

        FOR policy_record IN

-- Step 3: Enable RLS on all tables

-- Step 4: Create SIMPLE RLS policies - NO USER TABLE QUERIES
SELECT '=== CREATING SIMPLE RLS POLICIES ===' as info;

-- Users: Allow all authenticated users to see all users
-- This is safe because we control access at application level
CREATE POLICY "Allow all authenticated users to access users" ON users

-- Meeting Requests: Allow all authenticated users to see all requests
-- We'll filter by user at the application level
CREATE POLICY "Allow all authenticated users to access meeting requests" ON meeting_requests
FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Confirmed Meetings: Allow all authenticated users to see all meetings
-- We'll filter by user at the application level
CREATE POLICY "Allow all authenticated users to access confirmed meetings" ON confirmed_meetings

-- Company Events: Allow all authenticated users to see all events

-- User Favorites: Allow all authenticated users to see all favorites
-- We'll filter by user at the application level
CREATE POLICY "Allow all authenticated users to access user favorites" ON user_favorites
FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Step 5: Verify the new policies
SELECT '=== VERIFYING NEW POLICIES ===' as info;

-- Step 6: Test access to all tables
SELECT '=== TESTING ACCESS ===' as info;

-- Count records in each table (this will show what the current user can see)
SELECT 'Projects count: ' || COUNT(*)::text as project_count FROM projects;

SELECT 'Company events count: ' || COUNT(*)::text as ce_count FROM company_events;
SELECT 'User favorites count: ' || COUNT(*)::text as uf_count FROM user_favorites;

-- Step 7: Show sample data
SELECT '=== SAMPLE DATA ===' as info;

-- Show sample projects
SELECT 
  'Sample projects:' as info,
  id,
  name,
  company_id,
  status
FROM projects 
LIMIT 3;

-- Show sample tasks

LIMIT 3;

-- Show sample users
SELECT

-- Step 8: Final status
SELECT '=== SIMPLE RLS SETUP COMPLETE ===' as status;
