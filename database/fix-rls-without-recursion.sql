-- Fix RLS Without Disabling - Safe Admin Check Approach
-- This script fixes RLS policies to avoid infinite recursion while maintaining security

-- Step 1: Check current RLS status
SELECT '=== CURRENT RLS STATUS ===' as info;

SELECT 
  tablename,
  CASE WHEN rowsecurity THEN 'ENABLED' ELSE 'DISABLED' END as rls_status
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN (

  'documents', 
  'companies', 
  'users', 
  'internal_user_companies',
  'meeting_requests',
  'confirmed_meetings',
  'company_events',
  'user_favorites'
)
ORDER BY tablename;

-- Step 2: Drop existing policies to start fresh
SELECT '=== DROPPING EXISTING POLICIES ===' as info;

-- Step 3: Create a safe function to check if user is admin
-- This function avoids recursion by using a different approach

-- Test if the function works
