-- Add Back RLS Policies - Fixed Version (No Infinite Recursion)
-- This script adds RLS policies that restrict non-admin users while allowing admin users full access
-- Uses a different approach for the users table to avoid infinite recursion

-- Step 1: Check current RLS status
SELECT '=== CURRENT RLS STATUS ===' as info;

SELECT 
  tablename,
  CASE WHEN rowsecurity THEN 'ENABLED' ELSE 'DISABLED' END as rls_status
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN (
  'projects', 
  'tasks', 
  'document_folders', 
  'documents', 
  'companies', 
  'users', 
  'internal_user_companies',
  'meeting_requests',
  'confirmed_meetings',
  'company_events',
  'user_favorites'
)
ORDER BY tablename;

-- Step 2: Drop any existing policies first
SELECT '=== DROPPING EXISTING POLICIES ===' as info;

DO $$

    policy_record RECORD;
    table_name TEXT;

    -- List of tables to process
